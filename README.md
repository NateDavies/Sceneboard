# Sceneboard
The Sceneboard is a two page web app designed to provide users with ambient "scenes" through sounds and imagery. The first page allows users to click a button to 
select a preset blend of sounds with a corresponding background. 

The second page allows for more customization and gives users the opportunity to create their own scene
by selecting individual sounds with adjustable volumes and also allows them to select a background. 

There is a "Hide Content" button added so that the visibility of the
buttons and text can be toggled on and off so that the sounds and images can be enjoyed without obstruction.
